<h1> Blackjack switch rules</h1>
<ul>

  <li>Each player is dealt two face-up hands from 6 shuffled decks.</li>
  <li>The player must have equal bets for both hands.</li>
  <li>The second card of each hand can be switched prior to any other moves being made.</li>
  <li>Blackjack pays even money</li>
  <li>Dealer must hit on soft 17.</li>
  <li>If dealer has 22 it's a push.</li>
<li>The European no-hole-card rule is used. Meaning the dealer is only dealt one card originally and doesn't check for Blackjack if he has a 10 or ace.</li>
